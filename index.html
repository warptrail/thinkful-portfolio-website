                        web
                        with more power and style.

                    <h3>Developing</h3>
                    <p>The world Wide Web is the frontier of our age. In the relatively short amount of time it has
                        existed, it has transformed nearly every aspect of society. The new generations of people raised
                        on the Internet will surely find ways to use it to solve problems that we don’t even know we
                        have yet. </p>
                    <p>I am passionate about developing the web in a way that saves people time and money. By automating
                        the boring stuff with the power of interconnected computers, we clear up so much more time for
                        living life.</p>
                    <p>The web has become an integrated part of our lives. I seek to help make the experience as
                        efficient and pleasant as possible by building things that will help people help themselves.
                        Developing better ways to transmit information will strengthen organizations of all kinds so
                        that we may increase prosperity for all.

                    <h3>Networking</h3>
                    <p>The web is called the web because it is the mesh that brings computers and their users together.
                        Anybody on the planet can potentially say hello to anybody else. It’s rather amazing.</p>
                    <p>I do not intend to code in a vacuum. I hope my creations can be shared and integrated with your
                        creations. I seek to learn from others and stand on the shoulders of giants. One of the
                        interesting things about coding is that there are multiple ways to do the same task. Everybody
                        has their own style of problem solving.</p>
                    <p>It is most beneficial to everybody when we combine forces and think of solutions together. It
                        helps the individual grow and is more efficient for the group mission.</p>

                    <h3>Recharging</h3>
                    <p>Although it is easy for one to live life online all the time, I'm a big fan of disconnecting on a
                        regular basis to recharge. I have many artistic endeavors in the realms of music and graphic
                        design. I am also an eternal student of philosophy and science. Yoga is essential to life as a
                        developer, so I can recover from the screen time. My side gig is searching for the Lost City of
                        Atlantis.</p>
